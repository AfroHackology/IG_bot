# IG_bot
Instagram Bot that I created for a client that just wanted something that will help git their feet in the Instagram door.

I am mainly using OOP and functional programming along with an API in order to get the program working the way I would like it.
This program will like, comment, and post a picture. I am currently having trouble iterating through a folder with picture files so the post feature can iterate through said folder of said files and post them in succession. If anyone has a solution to this problem please leave a comment. I am still working on this project.
